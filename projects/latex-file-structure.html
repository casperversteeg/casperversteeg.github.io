            <p>For the longest time, I wrote all my LaTeX papers as one giant
            document that could become incredibly tough to navigate. I spent
            a long time looking for a file structure template that suits my
            needs, but was never really satisfied with anything I found. So, I
            decided to make my own:
            <a href="https://github.com/casperversteeg/latex-project-template"
              style="text-decoration:underline">Link to GitHub project.</a></p>
            <br/>
            <p>One of the things I was really looking for, was something that would
            allow me to do all the things I've been doing with LaTeX, but without
            the eternal hassle of copy-pasting document templates. Instead, I wanted
            something overseeable and simple to operate. Ideally, I was looking for
            something that resembled the structure used in the <a
            href="/projects/delaunay-mesher.html">Delaunay Mesher project</a> because
            I found that particularly convenient.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In the past, I have always used <a
              href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a> for LaTeX typesetting,
            but I have been migrating all my text editing to <a href="https://atom.io">
              Atom</a>. Atom provides a few packages for compiling LaTeX in-editor, although
            I was never really satisfied with those either, as I never really had the
            level of control I was looking for. Instead, I drew inspiration from the
            Delaunay Mesher project, and created this structure in such a way that
            <code>make</code> would do the exact same as <code>build</code> in Texmaker.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>So that's where we are. The template structure organizes all the aspects
            of a LaTeX project (i.e. bibliographies, classes and styles, images, etc.) into
            a set of sub-folders, which are all brought together into a single
            <code>.pdf</code> file with the <code>make</code> command. The most immediate
            consequence of this, is that all sections are split up into their own individual
            files (with the <code>standalone</code> documentclass), meaning they are
            much lighter and simpler to navigate than large, bulky projects. Furthermore,
            re-ordering sections is as simple as moving a single <code>\input{}</code> or
            <code>\import{}{}</code> line.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Most of the development time went into figuring out the <code>Makefile</code>.
            I was not too familiar with how to build a <code>Makefile</code>, and had mostly
            relied on combining functionality from other projects or online examples. A
            popular solution for my specific problem is the <code>latexmk</code> package,
            although I was running into too many issues trying to compile these modular
            documents. Indeed, the simpler solution is usually the better one, so I wrote
            a <code>Makefile</code> based on some tutorials I had found, and just built
            my LaTeX documents the same way I had always configured Texmaker: with
            <code>pdflatex</code>. So that's what it does. It envokes the <code>pdflatex</code>
            function as many times as I know necessary for most of my previous projects,
            and makes compiling the bibliography a separate option. Lastly, there are some
            other options that have made my life easier from time to time, such as
            <code>clean</code>, <code>verbose</code> for debugging, <code>force</code> in
            case it's not recognizing changes to sub-files (and it never will), <code>bib</code>
            and <code>index</code> for making bibliographies and indeces, and <code>superclean</code> to
            remove pretty much everything and restores the repository to just the bare <code>.tex</code>
            files.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Now, it has some disadvantages, unfortunately. Primarily, it's not really
            too efficient as it will always run <code>pdflatex</code> three times, even
            though that may not be necessary. Furthermore, <code>latexmk</code> has the
            functionality to watch changes in included <code>.tex</code> files, and would
            re-compile the document whenever an included file was changed. While useful,
            this functionality could also be quite infuriating whenever <code>latexmk</code>
            would get stuck on errors, so it's not included in this project (also in part
            because I haven't the faintest how I would go about implementing such a thing).</p>
