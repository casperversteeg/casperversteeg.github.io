              Welcome to my website! I am Casper Versteeg, an international
              student from The Netherlands, pursuing a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at
              <a href="http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> with an emphasis in computational mechanics.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-b-10">
              I moved to the United States in 2014 to attend the <a href="http://www.uga.edu">University of Georgia</a>,
              from where I graduated in 2018 with a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering.
              During my time at UGA, I worked on a variety of projects, most notably
              I was the mechanical team lead at the <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu">Small Satellite Research Laboratory</a>
              where we developed CubeSats for NASA and the Air Force. I was in charge
              of both the SPOC and MOCI missions at some point during my tenure there.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-b-10">
              I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Duke University under John E. Dolbow,
              with his computational mechanics research group, focussed on fracture
              mechanics, using finite elements.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-b-10">
              Take a look around my website! There are pages that describe some of the
              projects I've worked on, work I published, and some photography to show
              you some of my interests. There is also a page dedicated to my professional
              and academic career, which includes places I have worked, courses I have taken and the grade achieved.
              You can also download my resume by clicking the <a href="#">Download CV</a> button up top.
